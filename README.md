## Project title
React Jeopardy is exactly what it sounds like - a bare bones implementation of the game Jeopardy built using React. 
Basic functionality can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/YqJLycB1oxU).

## Motivation
I love Jeopardy and I wanted to get more hands on experience with React in a low stakes environemnt. This project is meant to not only give me more fun facts but also to further my React skills.
